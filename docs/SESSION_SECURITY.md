# Session Security Improvements

This document outlines the session security improvements implemented to address Issue #1 in the CSEC_322_FINAL_PROJECT repository.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Session Timeout Configuration

Added configuration settings in `app.py` to control session lifetime and security:

```python
app.config['PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME'] = datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)  # Session expires after 30 minutes of inactivity
app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE'] = True  # Ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS
app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY'] = True  # Prevent JavaScript access to session cookie
app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE'] = 'Lax'  # Restrict cookie sending to same-site requests
```

### 2. Session Regeneration Implementation

Added a helper function to regenerate the session ID to mitigate session fixation attacks:

```python
def regenerate_session():
    """
    Regenerate the session to prevent session fixation attacks.
    This preserves the Flask-Login login status while creating a new session ID.
    """
    # Save important values from the current session
    old_session = dict(session)
    # Clear the session
    session.clear()
    # Generate new session ID
    session.sid = uuid.uuid4().hex
    # Mark the session as modified to ensure it's saved
    session.modified = True
    # Restore the saved values
    for key, value in old_session.items():
        # Skip Flask internal keys that will be regenerated
        if key not in ['_flashes', '_fresh', '_id', '_permanent']:
            session[key] = value
```

### 3. Login Route Enhancement

Updated the login route to:
- Set sessions as permanent (respecting the timeout configuration)
- Regenerate the session ID after successful login
- Fix the formatting issue in the deactivated user redirection

### 4. Session Regeneration at Critical Points

Added session regeneration to key security-sensitive operations:
- After successful login
- After password reset
- After account activation/deactivation by admins
- After toggling admin privileges (promotion/demotion)
- Properly clearing the session on logout

### 5. Logout Enhancement

Improved the logout function to completely clear the session before logging out the user:

```python
@app.route('/logout')
def logout():
    # Clear the session before logging out the user
    session.clear()
    logout_user()
    return redirect(url_for('login'))
```

## Security Benefits

These improvements provide the following security benefits:

1. **Reduced Session Hijacking Risk**: By implementing secure cookie settings (HTTPS-only, HttpOnly, SameSite)
2. **Protection Against Session Fixation**: By regenerating the session ID after authentication and privilege changes
3. **Automatic Session Expiration**: By configuring a reasonable timeout period (30 minutes)
4. **Proper Session Termination**: By completely clearing session data on logout

## Best Practices Implemented

1. Sessions expire after a reasonable period of inactivity (30 minutes)
2. Session cookies are properly secured with modern protection mechanisms
3. Session IDs are regenerated at critical security points
4. Sessions are properly cleared on logout

## Testing Recommendations

When testing these security improvements, consider:

1. Verifying that sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity
2. Confirming that session cookies have the proper security flags set (secure, httponly, samesite)
3. Checking that session IDs change after login, password reset, and privilege changes
4. Ensuring that logout completely terminates the session
