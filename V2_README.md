## Introduction
Simple Banking App is a Flask-based web application designed to simulate a basic banking system. This application provides users with the ability to manage accounts, transfer funds, and perform basic banking operations in a secure environment.

## Objectives
1. Develop a comprehensive web-based banking application with robust security measures
2. Implement essential banking features with appropriate security controls
3. Identify and remediate common web application security vulnerabilities
4. Enhance user experience with security-focused feedback and notifications
5. Deploy a secure application to a cloud hosting platform (PythonAnywhere)
6. Document security improvements and provide comprehensive setup instructions

## e. Original Application Features

1. **User Authentication**
   - Login with username/password
   - Registration of new users
   - Password recovery mechanism (email-based)

2. **Account Management**
   - Display of account balance
   - View of transaction history (last 10 transactions)

3. **Fund Transfer**
   - Transfer money to other registered users
   - Confirmation screen before completing transfers
   - Transaction history updated after transfers

4. **User Role Management**
   - Regular user accounts
   - Admin users with account approval capabilities
   - Manager users who can manage admin accounts

5. **Location Data Integration**
   - Philippine Standard Geographic Code (PSGC) API integration
   - Hierarchical location data selection (Region, Province, City, Barangay)

## f. Security Assessment Findings: Vulnerabilities Identified in the Original Application

Despite the following security measures already in place:
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- CSRF protection on forms
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure session management
- Two-step transaction confirmation
- Admin approval workflow for new accounts

The initial application still has several security vulnerabilities that need to be addressed:

1. **Password Security Issues**
   - Insufficient password complexity requirements
   - Inadequate protection against password brute force attacks
   - No password expiration policy or account lockout mechanism

2. **Session Management Vulnerabilities**
   - Inadequate session timeout settings
   - Lack of protection against session fixation attacks
   - No prevention of browser back button access to protected content

3. **Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses**
   - Insufficient role-based access control
   - Vulnerable to URL manipulation attacks(bug in RBAC)
   - Missing CSRF protection on critical forms
   - No rate limiting for sensitive endpoints

4. **User Input Validation**
   - Inadequate validation of form inputs
   - No protection against XSS attacks
   - Insufficient error handling

5. **UX and Security Balance**
   - Lack of clear validation error messages
   - No confirmation for critical actions
   - Insufficient feedback for security events

## g. Initial Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python with Flask framework
- **Database**: MySQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login, Flask-Bcrypt
- **Security**: Flask-Limiter, CSRF protection
- **Forms**: Flask-WTF

## h. Penetration Testing Report: Summary of Vulnerabilities Identified, Exploitation Steps, and Recommendations

We used Burp Suite, a professional web vulnerability testing tool that includes essential features such as Proxy, Repeater, Intruder, and Decoder, which allowed us to intercept, modify, and analyze HTTP requests. In our test, we assessed a target website by capturing user login credentials through the Intercept feature and forwarding the request to Repeater, where we attempted to manipulate the username, password, user role, and session token. Our exploitation attempts were successful; we were able to get the users' credentials due to the system failure to hash it. Aside from that, we also made penetration test using developer tool in web and below are some of the results: 


### 1. Password Security Vulnerabilities

**Vulnerability**: Weak password requirements and validation
- **Exploitation Steps**: 
  1. Created accounts with simple passwords like "password123" that passed validation
  2. Used common password lists to successfully brute force multiple accounts
  3. Observed that password complexity was not enforced

**Recommendations**:
- Implement strict password complexity requirements (minimum length, character diversity)
- Add password strength meters on registration forms
- Implement account lockout after multiple failed attempts

### 2. Session Management Vulnerabilities

**Vulnerability**: Insufficient session security
- **Exploitation Steps**:
  1. Captured session cookies and reused them after extended periods
  2. Successfully accessed authenticated pages using browser back button after logout
  3. Demonstrated session fixation by setting a known session ID before login

**Recommendations**:
- Implement proper session timeout settings
- Use secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite cookie attributes
- Regenerate session IDs on authentication state changes
- Add cache control headers to prevent browser caching of sensitive pages

### 3. CSRF Vulnerabilities

**Vulnerability**: Missing CSRF protection on critical forms
- **Exploitation Steps**:
  1. Created a malicious website that submitted forms to the banking application
  2. Successfully performed fund transfers without user knowledge
  3. Modified user account details through cross-site requests

**Recommendations**:
- Implement CSRF tokens on all forms, especially for sensitive operations
- Add SameSite cookie restrictions
- Implement proper referrer checking

### 4. Input Validation and XSS Vulnerabilities

**Vulnerability**: Inadequate input validation allowing XSS attacks
- **Exploitation Steps**:
  1. Injected JavaScript into form fields that were displayed to other users
  2. Stole session cookies through injected JavaScript

**Recommendations**:
- Implement strict input validation for all user inputs
- Use proper output encoding when displaying user-provided data

### 5. Rate Limiting Vulnerabilities

**Vulnerability**: Lack of rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- **Exploitation Steps**:
  1. Used automated tools to perform thousands of login attempts per minute
  2. Attempted large numbers of transfers to identify valid account numbers
  3. Overwhelmed server resources with repeated requests

**Recommendations**:
- Implement rate limiting on all sensitive endpoints
- Add progressive delays for repeated failed attempts
- Implement IP-based throttling for suspicious activity

## i. Remediation Plan: Steps Taken to Address Identified Vulnerabilities
